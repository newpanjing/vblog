python3 提示ssl错误

提示：

`
Traceback (most recent call last):
File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
File "/usr/local/python3/lib/python3.6/ssl.py", line 101, in <module>
import _ssl # if we can't import it, let the error propagate
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named '_ssl'
`


解决方法：

重新编译python3，在编译的时候加上ssl参数

进入源码目录，然后输入以下命令
`
./configure --with-ssl
make & make install

`
以上都不能解决的话，先安装这两个软件

`
yum install openss openssl-devel -y
`

然后在重新编译安装才生效

```shell
./configure --with-ssl
make & make install
```
